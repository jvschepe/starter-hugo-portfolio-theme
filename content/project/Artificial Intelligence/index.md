As a group we are looking into ways of how recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can be leveraged into clinical healthcare. 

## Yes vs No

We have recently contribute to both the [yes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13524585221130421) and [NO](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13524585221125376?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) statement in an MSJ controversy series on whether AI will change MS healthcare within 10 years. 

## Federated learning

We strongly believe that the future of AI does not lie within large centralised databases, but rather that we have to leverage clinical datasets through federated learning. A first proof-of-concept paper by Stjn Denissen can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.22.23288741v1).
