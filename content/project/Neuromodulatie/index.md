Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a promising developing field for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have indicated that electrical stimulation can recover a patient's cognitive abilities during stimulation. 

## Rodent research

As it is currently unknown whether repeated stimulation could enhance remyelination and through which processes, we are setting up experiments to test the effect of repeated tACS administration in mice.

Non-invasive brain stimulation falls victim to large intersubject differences. Whereas different software packages enable the simulation of electrical current densities using personal MR images, it is not clear to which extent the segementation of the different brain tissues affects the results. This is of crucial importance to translate the results to people with neurological diseases where tissue segmentation is more difficult.
