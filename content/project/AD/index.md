My team is currently working on a comparison between cryogenic and OPM based MEG to detect early features of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. As the detection requires a long term follow-up, we teamed up with DIGITA to set up a system of personal data vaults. In this way, the person with AD remains owner of the data. 

Previously, I have worked on the following projects: 
- Automated segmentation of the corpus callosum and its relationship to clinical pathology 
- EEG analysis in which we use the alpha peak frequency to distinguish people with AD from people with frontotemporal dementia
