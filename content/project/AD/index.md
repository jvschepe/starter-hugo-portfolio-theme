I have worked on the following aspects of Alzheimer’s disease: 
- Automated segmentation of the corpus callosum and its relationship to clinical pathology
- EEG analysis in which we use the alpha peak frequency to distinguish people with AD from people with frontotemporal dementia 
- A comparison between cryogenic and OPM based MEG to detect early features of Alzheimer’s disease. As the detection requires a long follow-up, we teamed up with Digital.AI to set up a system of personal data vaults. In this way, the person with AD remains owner of the data.
