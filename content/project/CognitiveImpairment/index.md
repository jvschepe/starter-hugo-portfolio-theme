Cognitive impairment is an important and integral part of multiple sclerosis. Throughout the past decade, our group has worked on several aspects of CI leading to several key publications :

# Characterizing cognitive impairment and deterioration
In [Van Schependom et al](../../publication/pmid-24850580/pmid-24850580.pdf), we have shown that the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) acts as an excellent sentinel test for impairment in different cognitive domains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that patients tend to accrue impairment first on information processing speed and hypothesized that reduced information processing speed may even drive poor performance on other cognitive tests. 

# Developing multimodal biomarkers for cognitive impairment
As cognitive impairment is notoriously difficult and costly to assess in MS, we have worked on the development of novel, more objective markers of cognitive impairment by analysing the P300 waveform, shape analysis of the corpus callosum,  fMRI functional connectivity analysis, [MEG dynamic networks](../../publication/pmid-31361073/pmid-31361073.pdf) and serum/CSF biomarkers. 

# Characterizing disease evolution
As MS is such a complex disease, I strongly believe in the value of multimodal biomarkers to improve follow-up. I have worked on EEG, MEG, MRI segmentation and fMRI and have contributed to to analysis of CSF/serum measurements. For important remarks on fMRI/EEG/MEG, see here. 

# New treatment designs for CI in MS
As cognitive impairment is difficult to treat, we are working on novel treatment designs. Delphine Van Laethem is investigating the beneficial effects of combined physical/cognitive training and I am exploring if non-invasive neuromodulation could provide a new way to sustainably enhance cognition in people with MS.
