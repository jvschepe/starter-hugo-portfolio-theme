The DetectDem is a recently approved Innoviris project in which we will leverage a novel imaging technique (called Optically pumped magnetometers) to provide an earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease and an improved prediction of who is at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease dementia. As one of the hypothesis as to why many clinical trials targeting Alzheimer's disease have failed is that treatment is started only when dementia becomes apparent (and may be too late), the early detection is of extreme importance. 

These studies require a long follow-up by design. We want to be able to reach out to the same patient population in ten years time. Yet, this clashes with privacy regulations. To resolve these matters, we have teamed up with Digita.ai, Digita is a start-up company that is developing new technology that keeps data owernship with the patients. This way, patients can choose to share their (clinical/research) data for other clinical/research purposes.
