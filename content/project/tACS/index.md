Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a promising developing field for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have indicated that electrical stimulation can recover a patient's cognitive abilities during stimulation. In this FWO funded project, we will investigate whether repeated application of tES also induces structural changes, e.g. by enhancing endogenous remyelination processes. 

This project contains a preclinical line of research in which the techniques are tested in mice and an engineering line of research in which the distributions of electrical field strenghts in MS patients can be optimised.
