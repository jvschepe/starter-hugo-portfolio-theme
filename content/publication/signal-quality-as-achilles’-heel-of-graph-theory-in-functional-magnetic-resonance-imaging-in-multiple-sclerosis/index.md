abstract: Graph-theoretical analysis is a novel tool to understand the
  organisation of the brain. We assessed whether altered graph theoretical
  parameters, as observed in multiple sclerosis (MS), reflect pathology-induced
  restructuring of the brain's functioning or result from a reduced signal
  quality in functional MRI (fMRI). In a cohort of 49 people with MS and a
  matched group of 25 healthy subjects (HS), we performed a cognitive evaluation
  and acquired fMRI. From the fMRI measurement, Pearson correlation-based
  networks were calculated and graph theoretical parameters reflecting global
  and local brain organisation were obtained. Additionally, we assessed metrics
  of scanning quality (signal to noise ratio (SNR)) and fMRI signal quality
  (temporal SNR and contrast to noise ratio (CNR)). In accordance with the
  literature, we found that the network parameters were altered in MS compared
  to HS. However, no significant link was found with cognition. Scanning quality
  (SNR) did not differ between both cohorts. In contrast, measures of fMRI
  signal quality were significantly different and explained the observed
  differences in GTA parameters. Our results suggest that differences in network
  parameters between MS and HS in fMRI do not reflect a functional
  reorganisation of the brain, but rather occur due to reduced fMRI signal
  quality.
