[comment]: <> (👋 Hi, there!)

I'm **Jeroen**, an engineer-neuroscientist at VUB and I work on cognitive impairment in neurological diseases.

My team aims to understand how neurodegenerative diseases affect specific cognitive functions and leverage this knowledge into novel treatments to improve cognitive functioning. You can find my main research interests and projects [here](/project/)
