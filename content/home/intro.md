ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there! I'm **Jeroen**, an engineer-neuroscientist at VUB
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #FFB76B; background: linear-gradient(to right, #FFB76B 0%, #FFA73D 30%, #FF7C00 60%, #FF7F04 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}

My research focusses on cognitive impairment in neurological diseases. 

My team aims to understand how neurodegenerative diseases affect specific cognitive functions and leverage this knowledge into novel treatments to improve cognitive functioning.  

Check out my [CV](/about/) 

My main interests focus on: 

# Our main areas of expertise are:
# * Dynamic analysis of MEG/EEG/fMRI data of people with MS or AD
# * Improving cognitive assessment in standard care
# * Simulations of current densities induced by tES in people with neurological diseases
# * Understanding the mechanisms underlying tES applications through preclinical models
