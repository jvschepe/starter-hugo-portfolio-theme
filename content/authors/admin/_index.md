I am associate professor at the department of Electronics and Informatics ([ETRO](http://etrovub.be/)) and the AI supported modelling in clinical sciences ([AIMS](http://aims.research.vub.be/)) at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. I work on the development of novel biomarkers for cognitive impairment, mainly for multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, and explore novel treatments.
